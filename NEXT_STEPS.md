## 🎯 COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### ✅ Issues Fixed from Week 2 Generation

1. ✅ **HTML Template Formatting** - FIXED
   - Updated `build_combined_html()` method in `scripts/generate_shows.py`
   - Now uses Week 1 template with proper header, navigation, logos, and styling
   - All future shows will have correct formatting

2. ✅ **Holden Nobody Character Error** - FIXED

   - Updated 4 locations in `UWA_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`:
     - Roster section (2 locations)

     - "HOLDEN NOBODY'S CHAMPIONSHIP REIGN" storyline
   - Story is now properly a rookie underdog vs. seasoned destroyer

3. ⏸️ **Repetition Prevention** - NOT YET ADDRESSED (next priority)

---

## 📋 NEXT ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1: Address Repetition Prevention

**Problem:** Segment titles and storyline beats are repeating across weeks:
- Week 1 REIGN: "The Mind Games Begin" (Ryan Odyssey opening segment)
- Week 2 REIGN: "The Mind Games Begin" (Ryan Odyssey opening segment)

**Goal:** Each week should feel like episodic television with:
- Unique segment titles
- Fresh story beats
- No repetitive patterns
- Progression and evolution

**Approach:** Update the Claude prompt in `generate_shows.py` to:
1. Include a check for repetitive segment titles
2. Add variation requirements
3. Possibly track segment names used in previous weeks
4. Emphasize freshness and uniqueness in storytelling

---

     - Full navigation (Home, About, Results, Archive)

## � READY FOR NEXT GENERATION

**Status:** System is ready for Week 3 generation

**Changes Applied:**
1. ✅ HTML template will match Week 1 format
2. ✅ Holden Nobody will be correctly characterized as rookie
3. ⏳ Repetition prevention still needs implementation

**Next Generation Options:**
- Can regenerate Week 2 with correct formatting and character description
- Can proceed to Week 3 (repetition prevention can be added after)
- Can implement repetition prevention first, then generate

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION FOR NEXT SESSION

**Option 1: Quick Win**
- Regenerate Week 2 with the fixes applied
- Verify output looks correct
- Deploy to FTP
- This gives you clean Week 2 content immediately

**Option 2: Full Solution**
- Implement repetition prevention system
- Update prompt with variation requirements
- Then regenerate Week 2
- This addresses all three issues at once

**Option 3: Move Forward**
- Generate Week 3 with current fixes
- Week 2 remains as-is (not critical)
- Address repetition prevention for Week 4+

I recommend **Option 2** (Full Solution) to ensure all issues are resolved before moving forward.

## 📝 REPETITION PREVENTION DESIGN (For Next Session)

**Possible Approaches:**

1. **Prompt Enhancement:**
   - Add explicit instruction: "Do NOT reuse segment titles from previous weeks"
   - Provide examples of what to avoid
   - Emphasize creativity and variation

2. **Segment Title Tracking:**
   - Create `tracking/segment-titles.json`
   - Log all segment titles used
   - Pass recent titles to Claude with "do not use these"

3. **Template Variation:**
   - Provide multiple segment naming patterns
   - Rotate between different storytelling structures
   - Encourage different opening/closing formats

**Needs Discussion:**
- Which approach fits best with your workflow?
- How many weeks back should we check for repetition?
- Should we track per-brand or across all brands?
